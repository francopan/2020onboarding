# NBA Stats

This displays NBA stats from a [public api](https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/free-nba).

The project is divided in three parts:

- nba-base-app: A backbone app that will list matches, teams and players.
- nba-react-components: A react app that will build the components for the base app to use.
- nba-api: A typescript app that will serve as a middleware application to fetch the data from the api.

Each project will have its own README with its own instructions.
